You can change the visibility of a scoped package from the website.

You must be the owner of the user account or organization that owns the package in order to change package visibility.

## Making a public package private
If you want to restrict access and visibility for a public package you own, you can make the package private. When you make a package private, its access will be updated immediately and it will be removed from the website within a few minutes of the change.

### Using the website 
- On the dartpm website, go to the package page https://dartpm.com/package/package-name
- On the package page, click Settings.
<img src={packageSettings} style={{ border: `1px solid black` }}/>

- Update package settings.
<img src={packageSettingsMakePrivate} style={{ border: `1px solid black` }} width="500"/>
