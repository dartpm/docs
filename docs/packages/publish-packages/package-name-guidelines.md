title: Package naming guidelines
---

When choosing a name for your package, choose a name that
- is unique
- is descriptive
- meets dartpm policy guidelines. For example, do not give your package an offensive name, and do not use someone else's trademarked name or violate the dartpm trademark policy.

Additionally, when choosing a name for an unscoped package, also choose a name that
- is not already owned by someone else.
- is not spelled in a similar way to another package name.
- will not confuse others about authorship.
