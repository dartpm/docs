title: About private packages
---

With npm private packages, you can use the npm registry to host code that is only visible to you and chosen collaborators, allowing you to manage and use private code alongside public code in your projects.

Private packages always have a scope, and scoped packages are private by default.

- User-scoped private packages can only be accessed by you.

- Organization-scoped private packages can only be accessed by teams that have been granted read or read/write access. For more information, see "Managing team access to organization packages".
