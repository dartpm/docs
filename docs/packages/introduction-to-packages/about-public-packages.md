title: About Public Packages
---

As a dartpm user or organization user (Member/Admin), you can create and publish public packages that anyone can download and use in their own projects.

Public packages can be either scoped or unscoped:

- Scoped public packages belong to a user or organization and must be preceded by the user or organization name when included as a dependency
- For organization registry: "https://dartpm.com/registry/org-name"
- For user registry: "https://dartpm.com/registry/username"

## Benefits of Public Packages

- Free to use
