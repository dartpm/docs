As an dartpm user or organisation user(Member/Admin), you can create and publish public packages that anyone can download and use in their own projects.

- Unscoped public packages exist in the global public registry namespace "https://dartpm.com"

- Scoped public packages belong to a user or organisation and must be preceded by the user or organisation name when included as a dependency 
  - For user account registry is "https://dartpm.com/registry/username"
  - For organisation registry is"https://dartpm.com/registry/org-name"
