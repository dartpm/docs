---

Organizations cannot be renamed from the website or command line interface.

## Alternative options

If you need to change your organization's name, you have the following options:

1. Create a new organization with the desired name
2. Transfer your packages to the new organization
3. Delete the old organization

## Important considerations

- Package URLs will change when moving to a new organization
- Users will need to update their dependencies to point to the new organization
- Consider communicating the change to your users before making this transition
