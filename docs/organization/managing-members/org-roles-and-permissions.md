There are three roles in an organization:

- **Owner**: Can manage organization settings, members, and packages
- **Admin**: Can manage members and packages
- **Member**: Can view and use packages

On the dartpm registry, you cannot remove the last owner from an organization. To delete an organization, contact dartpm support.
