As an organization member, you can create and publish public and private packages within the organization's scope. 

:::info[Note]
Before creating and publishing packages, ensure you are logged in to your dartpm account using `dartpm login`. You must also have the appropriate permissions within your organization to publish packages.

## Creating an organization-scoped package

1. On the command line, create a Flutter package:
    ```bash
    flutter create --template=package hello
    ```

2. Navigate to the root directory of your package: 
    ```bash
    cd hello    
    ```

3. To create an organization-scoped package, update `pubspec.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    publish_to: "https://dartpm.com/registry/<scope-name>"
    ```

## Publishing a private organization-scoped package

By default, `dart pub publish` will publish a scoped package as private.

Any scoped package is published as private by default. However, if you have an organization that does not have the Private Packages feature, `dart pub publish` will publish public package.
1. On the command line, navigate to the package directory. 

2. Run `dartpm publish`.

Private packages will say `private` below the package name on the dartpm website.

## Publishing a public organization-scoped package

By default, `dart pub publish` will publish a scoped package as private.

To publish an organization-scoped package as public, follow these steps:

1. On the command line, navigate to the package directory.

2. Run `dartpm publish`.

3. After publishing, the package visibility depends on your organization's settings:
   - If your organization has the Private Packages feature, the package will be published as private by default. You can change it to public through the web interface.
   - If your organization does not have the Private Packages feature, the package will be published as public automatically.

Public packages will say `public` below the package name on the dartpm website.
