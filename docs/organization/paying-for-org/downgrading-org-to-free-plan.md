title: Downgrading to a free plan
---

As an organization owner, you can downgrade your organization from a paid plan to a free plan.

## Before downgrading

Before downgrading, consider:

- All private packages will become inaccessible
- You'll lose access to paid features
- Your organization members will need to adjust their workflows

## How to downgrade

1. Log in to your dartpm account
2. Navigate to your organization settings
3. Click on "Billing"
4. Select "Downgrade to free plan"
5. Confirm the downgrade

:::warning[Important]
Downgrading will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. You will continue to have access to paid features until then.
:::

## After downgrading

Once downgraded, your organization will:

- Only have access to public package publishing
- No longer have access to private packages
- Return to free plan limitations

## Package migration

If you have private packages, you should:

1. Make them public before downgrading, or
2. Archive them if they should no longer be available

:::info[Note]
You can upgrade back to a paid plan at any time if you need access to private packages again.
