As an organization owner, you can upgrade your free organization plan to the dartpm Organization product. dartpm Organization is a paid plan to give organization members the ability to install and publish private packages. For more information about dartpm Organization pricing plans, see the "dartpm Organization" section of our pricing page.

If you have an organization with a private packages plan, your organization will cost you seven (12) dollars a month per user. The $12 charge is a flat fee for any member of the organization even if the teams the member belongs do not have access to private packages

Newly added members to an organization are always billed during the current billing cycle. For more information, see "Adding members to your organization".
