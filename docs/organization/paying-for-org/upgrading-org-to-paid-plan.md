As an organisation owner, you can upgrade your free organisation plan to the dartpm Organisation product. dartpm Organisation is a paid plan to give organisation members the ability to install and publish private packages. For more information about dartpm Organisation pricing plans, see the "dartpm Organisation" section of our pricing page.

If you have an organisation with a private packages plan, your organisation will cost you twelve (12) dollars a month per user. The $12 charge is a flat fee for any member of the organisation even if the teams the member belongs do not have access to private packages

Newly added members to an organisation are always billed during the current billing cycle. For more information, see "Adding members to your organisation".
